# Examples Overview

The three examples in this section demonstrates successive levels of depth and completeness.

## Service at a Glance

The [service at a glance example](./at-a-glance.md) provides a one-page implementation of the basics of a service. It's not intended to be a runnable example as much as it is to demonstrate the various parts of a service in one place.

## Quickstart

The [quickstart example](./quickstart.md) demonstrates the setup of an Eventide Postgres project, configuring the message store database connection, and basic reading and writing of a message to a stream in the [Postgres message store](/user-guide/message-db/).

## Example Projects

The [example projects](./example-projects.md) are implementations of services that reflect more realistic implementations of services and their interactions.
