# Entity Store

An entity store is the primary means of retrieving [entities](/user-guide/entities.md) from the message store database.

Entity data is stored as events in an [event stream](/glossary.md#event-stream). Each entity has it's own stream. When an entity is "retrieved", its events are applied to the entity by a projection.

An entity store combines a [projection](/user-guide/projection.md), a [reader](/user-guide/readers.md), an temporary in-memory [cache](./entity-cache.md), and an durable on-disk cache to provide a simple and efficient interface for retrieving entities.

An entity's event stream is read by the reader specified by the `reader` macro, and projected by the projection specified by the `projection` macro. The entity returned from a retrieval operation is an instance of the class specified by the `entity` macro. The `category` macro declares the [category](/glossary.md#category) of the stream name that will be read when a retrieval operation is invoked.

To avoid the cost of projecting every event in an entity's stream when an entity is retrieved, the entity is cached when it is retrieved. The next time an entity is retrieved, only events that have been recorded since the last time the entity was retrieved are read and projected.

To avoid the cost of projecting all of an entity's events when the entity is not in the cache (as when a service has just been started), an entity is periodically persisted to disk in a snapshot stream. If an entity is retrieved and there's no cache entry for it, the latest snapshot will be retrieved and cached before the latest events are read and projected.

## Example

``` ruby
class Store
  include EntityStore

  entity Account
  category :account
  projection Projection
  reader MessageStore::Postgres::Read, batch_size: 1000

  # Snapshotting is optional and can be omitted
  snapshot EntitySnapshot::Postgres, interval: 100
end

store = Store.build

deposited = Deposited.new()
deposited.account_id = '123'
deposited.amount = 11

Messaging::Postgres::Write.(deposited, 'account-123')

account, version = store.fetch('123', include: :version)

account.balance
# => 11

version
# => 0

withdrawn = Withdrawn.new()
withdrawn.account_id = '123'
withdrawn.amount = 1

Messaging::Postgres::Write.(withdrawn, 'account-123')

deposited = Deposited.new()
deposited.account_id = '123'
deposited.amount = 111

Messaging::Postgres::Write.(deposited, 'account-123')

account, version = store.fetch('123', include: :version)

account.balance
# => 121

version
# => 2
```

## Entity Store Facts

- An entity store projects an entity's events when it is retrieved
- The entity store caches the retrieved entity
- Only events recorded since the last cached retrieval are projected
- An entity is retrieved by its ID
- An entity store can only be used to retrieve the entity class and category it's defined for
- An entity store's cache is only cleared when its service is restarted
- A store will optionally write snapshots of an entity on a specified interval

## EntityStore Module

A class becomes a store by including the `EntityStore` module from the [`EntityStore` library](../libraries.md#entity-store) and namespace.

The `EntityStore` module affords the receiver with:

- The `fetch` method for retrieving an entity by its ID (does not return nil)
- The `get` method for retrieving an entity by its ID (may return nil)
- The `get_version` method for retrieving just the stream's current version
- The `entity` macro for declaring the class of the entity that the store manages
- The `category` macro for declaring the stream category used to compose the entity's stream name
- The `projection` macro for declaring the projection class that the store uses
- The `reader` macro for declaring the platform-specific reader implementation to be used by the store
- The `snapshot` macro for declaring the snapshot implementation to be used by the store

## Retrieving an Entity

Entities can be retrieved in one of two ways:

- Via the `fetch` method
- Via the `get` method

The significant difference between the `fetch` and `get` methods is the return value when a non-existent entity is attempted to be retrieved. The `fetch` method will return a newly-constructed instance of the store's declared entity class. The `get` method will return a `nil`.

It's more common in handler business logic to use the `fetch` method so that the returned entity does not have to be checked for a `nil` value before being used.

### Fetch

``` ruby
fetch(id, include: nil)
```

**Returns**

Instance of the store's entity class with the identified stream's data projected onto it.

If the optional `include` argument is specified, data from the entity's cache record can be returned as well.

<div class="note custom-block">
  <p>
    Note: The <code>fetch</code> method never returns a <code>nil</code> when the entity retrieved does not exist (ie: There's no entity stream with the entity's ID). When the entity does not exist, rather than returning a <code>nil</code>, the <code>fetch</code> method will return a newly-constructed instance of the store's declared entity class.
  </p>
</div>

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | The ID of the entity to retrieve | String |
| include | List of cache record attributes to retrieve | Symbol or Array |

#### Entities Are Always Cached Before They Are Returned

Once the retrieval operation has completed reading and projecting the entity's events, the entity is inserted into the store's cache.

If there isn't a [cache record](./entity-cache.md#cache-record) already in the cache for the entity, a new cache record will be created. If the cache does have a cache record for the entity, that record is updated.

For more details on caching, see the [entity cache user guide](./entity-cache.md)

#### Including Cache Record Data in the Returned Values

The `include` named parameter returns selected data from the entity's cache record along with the entity.

It's important to note that the cache record is updated _before_ any data is returned.

The most common use of the `include` parameter is to retrieve the entity's version along with the entity.

``` ruby
entity, version = store.fetch(some_id, include: :version)
```

Any number of cache record attributes can be returned by specifying a list of cache record attribute names.

``` ruby
entity, version, time = store.fetch(some_id, include: :version, :time)
```

#### Cache Record Attributes That Can Be Included

| Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | The ID of the cached entity | String |
| entity | The cached entity itself | Object |
| version | The stream version of the cached entity at the time it was cached | Integer |
| time | The UTC time that the entity was cached | Time |
| persisted_version | The version of the entity that may have been persisted as a snapshot | Integer |
| persisted_time | The UTC time that the entity may have been persisted as a snapshot | Time |

#### The no_stream Stream Version

When an attempt is made to retrieve an entity that does not exist, the symbol `:no_stream` is returned as the value of `version`.

``` ruby
entity, version = store.fetch(some_non_existant_id, include: :version)

version
# => :no_stream
```

The `:no_stream` symbol is equivalent to a stream version of `-1`.

#### Retrieval Stream Name

The `category` macro declares the category of the stream name that will be read when a retrieval operation is invoked.

When an entity whose ID is `123` is retrieved from the store, the store's category is concatenated with the ID to form the event stream name to read.

``` ruby
class SomeStore
  include EntityStore

  category :some_entity
  # ...
end

store = SomeStore.build

# The store's reader reads from the stream "someEntity-123"
some_entity = store.fetch('123')

store.stream_name
# => "someEntity-123"
```

### Get

``` ruby
get(id, include: nil)
```

The `get` method is almost identical to the `fetch` method.

The significant difference between the `get` and `fetch` methods is the return value when a non-existent entity is attempted to be retrieved. The `get` method will return a `nil`. Whereas the `fetch` method will return a newly-constructed instance of the store's declared entity class.

The `get` method isn't typically a good choice in handler business logic, as it will require a `nil` check for each entity returned from the store due to the possibility that an entity returned from `get` may be `nil`

## Retrieving an Entity's Version

``` ruby
get_version(id)
```

**Returns**

Stream version of the stream identified by the `id` argument and the store's declared category.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | The ID of the entity whose version to retrieve | String |

<div class="note custom-block">
  <p>
    Note: Retrieving the version will cause a normal reading and projecting of recent, unprojected events and an update of the cache with the results.
  </p>
</div>

## Retrieval Workflow

The following is done by the store and its caches when an entity is retrieved:

1. Retrieval by ID is actuated by using either the store's `fetch`, `get`, or `get_version` method.
2. The in-memory, internal cache is checked for a cache record for the entity ID.
3. If the cache record is found, the entity and the version number are retrieved from the cache.
4. A stream reader retrieves and enumerates any events that may have been written since the entity was last cached, based on the version number that is cached with the entity.
5. Any new events are projected on to the entity.
6. The cache is updated with the updated entity and the updated entity version.
7. The entity is returned to the caller.

### When There Is No Cache Record

When there is no cache record found in step #2 (above), the following alternative flow happens:

1. Retrieval by ID is actuated by using either the store's `fetch`, `get`, or `get_version` method.
2. The in-memory, internal cache is checked for a cache record for the entity ID.
3. No cache record is found.
4. If the store's snapshotting is configured, the entity's snapshot will be retrieved from the external snapshot storage.
5. The retrieved snapshot and the entity version of the snapshot is inserted into the internal, in-memory cache.
6. A stream reader retrieves and enumerates any events that may have been written since the entity was last cached, based on the version number that is cached with the entity.
7. Any new events are projected on to the entity.
8. The cache is updated with the updated entity and the updated entity version.
9. The entity is returned to the caller.

### When There Is No Cache Record and No Snapshot

When neither a cache record is in the internal, in-memory cache _and_ there is no snapshot stored (or if the store's optional snapshotting is not configured), the following flow happens:

1. Retrieval by ID is actuated by using either the store's `fetch`, `get`, or `get_version` method.
2. The in-memory, internal cache is checked for a cache record for the entity ID.
3. No cache record is found.
4. If the store's snapshotting is configured, an attempt to retrieve the entity's snapshot is made.
5. There is no snapshot found.
6. A stream reader retrieves and enumerates any events that may have been written since the entity was last cached, based on the version number that is cached with the entity.
7. Any new events are projected on to the entity.
8. The cache is updated with the updated entity and the updated entity version.
9. The entity is returned to the caller.

## Defining an Entity Store

An entity store requires the declaration of:

- The store's entity class
- The stream category of the store's entity streams
- The projection class that the store uses to give an entity its data
- The reader used by the store to retrieve events that will be dispatched to the store's projection

``` ruby
class SomeStore
  include EntityStore

  entity SomeEntity
  category :some_entity
  projection SomeProjection
  reader MessageStore::Postgres::Read
end
```

### The entity Macro

``` ruby
self.entity(entity_class)
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| entity_class | Class of the entity that the store retrieves and caches instances of | Class |

The macro defines the `entity_class` instance method on the entity store that returns the class passed to the macro.

``` ruby
some_store.entity_class
# => SomeEntity
```

The macro defines the `entity_class` class method on the entity store class that returns the class passed to the macro.

``` ruby
SomeStore.entity_class
# => SomeEntity
```

### The category Macro

``` ruby
self.category(category)
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| category | Name of the category that the store's entities are retrieved from | Symbol or String |

The macro defines the `category` instance method on the entity store that returns the _normalized_ category name.

``` ruby
some_store.category
# => "someEntity"
```

<div class="note custom-block">
  <p>
    Note: The category name that is specified via the category macro will be normalized to the canonical _camel-cased_ form. If the input is the symbol <code>:some_entity</code>, it will be normalized to the string <code>someEntity</code>. If the input is a camel-cased string, it is not normalized.
  </p>
</div>

### The projection Macro

``` ruby
self.projection(projection_class)
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| projection_class | Class of the projection that the store uses to project state onto an entity | Class |

The macro defines the `projection_class` instance method on the entity store that returns the class passed to the macro.

``` ruby
some_store.projection_class
# => SomeProjection
```

### The reader Macro

``` ruby
self.reader(reader_class, batch_size: 1000)
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| reader_class | Class of the reader that the store uses to read the event stream of the entity being retrieved | Class |
| batch_size | Number of events at-a-time to be read from the message store | Integer |

The macro defines the `reader_class` instance method on the entity store that returns the class passed to the macro.

``` ruby
some_store.reader_class
# => MessageStore::Postgres::Read
```

The macro also defines the `reader_batch_size` instance method on the entity store that returns the batch size passed to the macro.

``` ruby
some_store.reader_batch_size
# => 1000
```

## Incomplete Store Definition

The definition of a store must specify all of the mandatory properties required for the operation of the store.

A store's definition **must** include declarations for:

- The entity class
- The category
- The projection class
- The reader class

If any of these are missing, the `EntityStore::Error` class is raised while the store class is evaluated.

## Optional Snapshotting

### The snapshot Macro

<div class="note custom-block">
  <p>
    The snapshot macro is optional and can be omitted.
  </p>
</div>

``` ruby
self.snapshot(snapshot_class, interval: nil)
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| snapshot_class | Class of the snapshot writer that the store uses to periodically snapshot the state of an entity | Class |
| interval | Interval, in messages read and projected, in which the entity state is written to its snapshot stream | Integer |

The macro defines the `snapshot_class` instance method and the `snapshot_interval` instance method on the entity store that returns the values passed to the macros.

``` ruby{8}
class SomeStore
  include EntityStore

  # ...
  snapshot EntitySnapshot::Postgres, interval: 100
end
```

## Deleting Cache Records from the Store's Internal Cache

``` ruby
delete_cache_record(id)
```

**Returns**

Returns the cache record that corresponds to the ID, or `nil` if there is no cache record for the ID.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | The entity ID of the cache record being deleted | String |

<div class="note custom-block">
  <p>
    Note: Deleting the cache record from the store's <a href="./entity-cache.html">internal cache</a> has no effect on any entity snapshots that have been recorded. If snapshots have been recorded, deleting the cache record from the internal cache does not delete the snapshot from the <a href="./snapshotting.html">external snapshot store</a>.
  </p>
</div>

## Constructing Entity Stores

Entity stores can be constructed in one of two ways:

- Via the constructor
- Via the initializer

### Via the Constructor

``` ruby
self.build(snapshot_interval: nil, session: nil)
```

**Returns**

Instance of the class that includes the `EntityStore` module.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| snapshot_interval | Optional interval in number of messages after which a snapshot is persisted if a snapshot writer is configured | Integer |
| session | Optionally, an existing [session](../session.md) object to use, rather than allowing the store to create a new session | MessageStore::Postgres::Session |

### Via the Initializer

``` ruby
self.initialize()
```

**Returns**

Instance of the class that includes the `EntityProjection` module.

By constructing a store using the initializer, the store's dependencies are not set to operational dependencies. They remain _inert substitutes_.
